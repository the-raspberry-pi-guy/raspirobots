## Book Description

Learn Robotics with Raspberry Pi will take you from inexperienced maker to robot builder. You’ll start off building a two-wheeled robot powered by a Raspberry Pi minicomputer and then program it using Python, the world’s most popular programming language. Gradually, you’ll improve your robot by adding increasingly advanced functionality until it can follow lines, avoid obstacles, and even recognize objects of a certain size and color using computer vision.

Learn how to:

* Control your robot remotely using only a Wii remote
* Teach your robot to use sensors to avoid obstacles
* Program your robot to follow a line autonomously
* Customize your robot with LEDs and speakers to make it light up and play sounds
* See what your robot sees with a Pi Camera

As you work through the book, you’ll learn fundamental electronics skills like how to wire up parts, use resistors and regulators, and determine how much power your robot needs. By the end, you’ll have learned the basics of coding in Python and know enough about working with hardware like LEDs, motors, and sensors to expand your creations beyond simple robots.

Requirements: Raspberry Pi and Python 3

## This repository?

This repository stores all of the code and resources used in the book. It will be updated when necessary and if the code requires changes.

## How to download?

You can download this code directly onto your Raspberry Pi with the terminal command:

`git clone https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/raspirobots`

Alternatively you can download this code locally by clicking on the "Clone or download" button at the top of the page. You will also find a zipped version of this code on the No Starch Press product page: https://nostarch.com/raspirobots

## Requirements/Recommendations

This book is compatible with all models of Raspberry Pi.

Recommended Pi Model: Raspberry Pi 3B+/3A+ or Pi Zero W (more efficient and lower power consumption)

## Parts List

These is an exhaustive list of the parts that I use in the book, Chapter by Chapter. I have tried to make things as cheap and accessible as possible.
